There are kernel modules with a version string.
`vermagic=2.6.15-sigma MIPS32_R2 32BIT gcc-3.4`

The executables in it, `xg1000` and `Karaoke` depend on
- GLIBCXX_3.4
- GCC_3.0
- CXXABI_1.3
- uClibc 0.9.27

I was able to run them in qemu-system-mips with
vmlinux-2.6.32-5-4kc-malta from https://people.debian.org/~aurel32/qemu/mipsel/
and an image built with buildroot git version 257dcdeabfc7072023050be6c8da46e0b76d478e in a debian etch VM
