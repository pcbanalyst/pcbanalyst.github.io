# Power supply
You can connect an ATX power supply through one of the empty SATA power connectors.
This will make most of the machine work except for Video out and Music out.
For that you will have to connect -12V and power the 7805 regulator from the 12V supply.
I've desoldered the diodes from the second analog power supply while I was looking for a short.

# Remote
Along with the second machine i got a PM200zB remote.
It has a Samsung ARM CPU and runs Linux 2.2.14-v5.1_PM200

# Software side
The first partition has a loader that is run by /etc/init.d/S50NK1000
The second partition doesn't have a filesystem and is accessed directly by the program.
The third partition has all the data but to obfuscate it they changed the ext3 header, changing that one byte makes it mountable again.

There are kernel modules with a version string.
`vermagic=2.6.15-sigma MIPS32_R2 32BIT gcc-3.4`

The executables in it, `xg1000` and `Karaoke` depend on
- GLIBCXX_3.4
- GCC_3.0
- CXXABI_1.3
- uClibc 0.9.27

I was able to run them in qemu-system-mips with
vmlinux-2.6.32-5-4kc-malta from https://people.debian.org/~aurel32/qemu/mipsel/
and an image built with buildroot git version 257dcdeabfc7072023050be6c8da46e0b76d478e in a debian etch VM

# Making it work again
!(error screen)[http://pcbwiki.eu/assets/images/dam/305.99994008.png] !(warning screen)[http://pcbwiki.eu/assets/images/dam/305.99994009.png]
The machine has telnet open and the "default" user has no password.
But you can log in and edit the /etc/shadow file to remove the root password.
Then reconnect and log in as root without a password.

As root you can run /NK1000/Data/MODUL/SetTime to reset the date and make the machine work again if it has expired.

# Hidden menus
## Service menu
When the machine is off but has power (the power button will have a red LED and the screen is off) hold the Tempo- and Tempo+ buttons and then press the power button.
Instead of the loading screen it will be black for a few seconds and then show the service menu.
You can also hold the Tempo up key from the normal mode.

You can do a bunch of setups here and run basic tests.

## Developer menu
To get in the developer menu, press the Tempo reset keys a few times from the Top menu.
It will then ask for a password, on older updates this is 8650 on newer ones it is 865024.
Here you can change the serial, set the IP address and format the TEMP partition.

## 99 Menus
When the machine is on and running in normal mode, press 99 and then the DAM key to open a quick settings menu.
Here you can adjust echo, volume and the type of background.
Navigate with Tempo and Key keys and close with the DAM key.

### 98 Menu
The same thing but it's a bar at the top of the screen instead of a big overlay

### 97 Menu
The same thing but it's a window in the top left of the screen.

### 96 Menu
This is something about video

## Owner mode
Play track number 0000-01
Here you can update the remote and permanently set some of the settings from the 99 menu.

## Remote settings
To get into the settings of the デンモク remote you press the "Remote" button in the bottom right.
Enter 983, then press メモリーセット.
it will show a message, then enter the 9193 password and press メモリーセット again

# Intro vid
7777-77 will play an Intro video that presents 4 feature:
1. Burn your terrible singing to disc
Yo check out my mixtape

2. SD card
Look at photos of your trip to the Korea DMZ while you sing.
((You need the Media dock for this))

3. iPod
Play music from your iPod
((You need the Media dock for this))

4. Game
There are at least 2 Games:
One that just measures how loud you've been and calculates burnt calories from that.
The calorie counter can be enabled/disabled in the owner menu.
You can check the calories for the last tracks using 8000-30.
A game like singstar where you actually have to kinda hit the tone to get a score.
To start this game enter song 8000-01 for ranked and 8000-02 for casual games.
You can look at past scores using 8000-99

# Easter egg
